@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\dl-labosi\lab2\asdfgh\serial_tx.vhd":78:1:78:2|Found inferred clock lab2|clk_25m which controls 74 sequential elements including I1.R_tx_ser[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
